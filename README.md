# Controller Plugin for the Dreadbox Nymphes

This plugin is a midi controller for the Dreadbox Nymphes. It receives and sends CC messages to reflect the actual settings of the Nymphes 6-voice synthesizer.
It is set-up for the latest v2 version of the firmware. Note that it will not work correctly with v1 as the mappings have been changed.
